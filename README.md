# Scope
This library aims to simplify automation across various devices and interfaces, with a focus
on minimal code writing requirements. It's ideal for home automation, being a good fit for people
with no prior experience in the domain and also serves as solid foundation for advanced
IoT projects utilizeing multiple devices, enabling seamless communication through the 
HTTP protocol.
# About
Actively working on the [FRL1.0](# "FIRSTRELEASE1.0")
 build, which consists of a client side html,css,js ui,
with functionality for connecting and initializeing inputs and outpus on connected esp32
devices, with the posibility of controlling digital, analog IO, and pulse-width-modulation,
other posibilities are also possible, and I accent propositions, feature requests, and external
commits and merges :).
# Active support
Active implementation supports digital and analog IO via the implmented Ui, and also features http 
endpoints on the esp-32 for controlling digital/analog IO.
